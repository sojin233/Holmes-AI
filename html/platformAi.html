              Being able to predict an episode of cardiac arrhythmias early enough would allow patients to take
              preventive measures to keep their cardiac rhythm stable. However, current methods based on the analysis of

              onset and do not provide an early warning. <br><br>

              Over 3 years of intensive research and development, we have succeeded in developing CLholmes® which
              accurately identifies 21 types of cardiac arrhythmia-matching the precision of cardiologists-level. Our
              novel technology classifies ECG into sub-waveforms (P, QRS, and T waves) and analyzes these patterns
              significantly to reduce the misdiagnosis rate to less than one-fifth compared to current commercialized AI
              technologies. Remarkably, CLholmes® achieves a diagnostic accuracy akin to a 12-lead ECG even with single
              ECG signals, boasting an AUROC: 0.9823, Sensitivity: 94.10%, Specificity: 94.33%.
